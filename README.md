Machine Learning model to predict house
price using linear regression only
Jupyter notebook code..
The data contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city

2. Wine Quality Prediction :
 The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine the quality of wines
based on specific attributes using linear regression. By training a machine learning
 model on a dataset comprising various wine characteristics, the model can predict the
 quality rating of a given wine sample. The Jupyter notebook code offers insights into
 the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages.

3. Iris Flowers Classification :
 This project focuses on the classification of different species of iris flowers
 using logistic regression. By considering the length of petals and sepals, the
machine learning model can identify the species accurately. The Jupyter notebook
 code provides comprehensive explanations of the data preprocessing, model training,
 and classification process
